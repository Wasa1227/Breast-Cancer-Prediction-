This project predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using machine learning. It uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset with features like cell size, shape, and texture. Data is cleaned, scaled, and split for model training. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM are tested for accuracy. The goal is to build a reliable model for early breast cancer detection.
